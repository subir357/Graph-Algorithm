# Graph-Algorithm
 Let G = (V, E) be a connected directed graph with non-negative edge weights,let s and t be vertices of G, and let H be a subgraph of G obtained by deleting some edges. Suppose we want to reinsert exactly one edge from G back into H, so that the shortest path from s to t in the resulting graph is as short as possible.
